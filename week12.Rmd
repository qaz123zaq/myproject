## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
```{r}
mydata<-read.csv("trees91.csv")

mydata$C <- factor(mydata$C)
mydata$N <- factor(mydata$N)

summary(mydata)
barplot(table(mydata$N))

```

```{r}
mydata1<-read.csv("trees91x.csv",encoding = "UTF-8")
mydata$`中文` <-factor(mydata1$`中文`)

table(mydata1$`中文`)
```

```{r}
mydata<-read.csv("trees91x.csv",encoding = "UTF-8")
#mydata$`中文` <-factor(mydata1$`中文`)
#table(mydata1$`中文`)

```



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
